# Electrocardiogram - Signal processing & feature extraction

This project was carried out as part of the signal processing course and is composed by two different phases. The first phase was the to extract features both in frequency and time domains. After this, unsupervised classification models were feeded with the data.

## Introduction
The "Abdominal and Direct Fetal Electrocardiogram" database contains fetal electrocardiogram (FECG) signals obtained from five women in labor, between 38 and 41 weeks pregnant. Each recording consists of four different signals from the maternal abdomen, and an electroencephalogram through the fetal head. The main purpose of capturing the signals is that they can be used to create new classification and clustering algorithms. In the medical context, especially in clinical examinations, anomalies can be detected before birth using simple algorithms. Feature transformation and selection techniques play an active role in this process.
